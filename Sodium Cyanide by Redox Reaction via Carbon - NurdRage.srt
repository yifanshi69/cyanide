1
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,259
warning sodium cyanide is an extremely

2
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,960
toxic poison this experiment must be

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,490
performed with gloves in a fume hood

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,710
this experiment also uses high

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,809
temperatures a fire safety protocols

6
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:18,090
must be in place this should only be

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,699
performed by experienced chemist now

8
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,949
seriously this is some crazy-ass weasel

9
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:27,119
 if you screw up you will die I'm

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,519
not joking around here the only reason

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,260
why I am doing this is because it's

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,320
necessary to make the drug pure methane

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,730
if you do not possess at least a

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,380
bachelor's degree in chemistry do not

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,440
try this doing it is straightforward but

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,899
staying safe required a safety mentality

17
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,730
that you can only get with actual lab

18
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:45,800
experience

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,350
seriously don't try this greetings

20
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,840
fellow nerds in this video we're going

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,570
to make sodium cyanide while it is

22
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,280
famous as lethal poison it is

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,109
tremendously useful in chemistry to

24
00:00:58,109 --> 00:00:59,550
manufacture other chemicals like

25
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,250
nitriles in fact the reason why it

26
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,220
became so famous as a poison is because

27
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,930
it's used so much in the industry that's

28
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,150
easy to access and get poisoned in both

29
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,700
accidentally and intentionally but there

30
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,380
are plenty of other even more toxic

31
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,509
chemicals but they aren't used enough to

32
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,189
become as well known as cyanide

33
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:19,799
I'll be using sodium cyanide to make a

34
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,479
nitrile compound for making pure

35
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,460
methanol now we're going to need

36
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,619
moderately high temperatures for this so

37
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,299
we're going to modify our heating mantle

38
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,610
we made in earlier video rather than

39
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,439
wrapping around a flask we're going to

40
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,049
wrap it around a steel can I'm using a

41
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:36,240
steel can and not a beaker because we're

42
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,180
going to melt sweet hydroxide later

43
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,680
molten sodium hydroxide eats through

44
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,659
glass so we have to use a metal can

45
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,240
instead my heating tape is falling apart

46
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,860
because I accidentally heat it beyond

47
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,259
the insulators max and temperature it's

48
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,030
still good for another use but I'm

49
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,670
buying a new tape soon for safety my

50
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,350
fume hood stands and other metal

51
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,229
connections are grounded anyway here is

52
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,659
the fully assembled unit it's darker in

53
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,520
color than earlier because I was doing

54
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,110
some heating as well as grounding test

55
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,540
to make sure it was safe to use let me

56
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,369
switch over to overhead camera since

57
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:10,080
looking at it from the side is boring

58
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,740
now the star we add 100

59
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,980
grams of solid rock side then we add 43

60
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,500
grams of cyanuric acid which is sold as

61
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
a chlorine stabilizer swimming pools

62
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,170
finally we add 12 grams of carbon now

63
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,970
give the mixture a good stir and slowly

64
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,240
ramp up the temperature to 600 Celsius

65
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,830
don't eat the mixture too fast roll

66
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,410
sputter go slowly over the course of an

67
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,660
hour as it starts to liquify

68
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,400
occasionally stir to make sure there are

69
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,890
no cold spots as temperature increases

70
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,830
the mixture may start to bubble this is

71
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,670
to be expected

72
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,190
first the cyanuric acid and sodium

73
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,440
hydroxide will react to form try sodium

74
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,080
sign aerated water at these temperatures

75
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,480
the water will boil off then as the

76
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,570
mixture reaches 550 Celsius the

77
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,490
trisodium cyanuric decomposes into

78
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,160
sodium cyanide this then reacts with

79
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,320
carbon to form carbon dioxide and sodium

80
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,260
cyanide some carbon dioxide will bubble

81
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,240
out but some will react with the same

82
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,850
hydroxide to make sodium carbonate there

83
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,530
should be constant bubbling if the

84
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,300
bubbling goes too fast and threatens to

85
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,310
overflow the heating mantle then turn

86
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,690
down the temperature to get back under

87
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:18,230
control

88
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,330
eventually the bubbling should slow down

89
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,010
and we can start raising the temperature

90
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,980
again once we reach citrate Celsius

91
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,780
without overflow we continued heating

92
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,760
for another hour the bubbling should

93
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,890
eventually stop then we turn off the

94
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,170
heating let the mixture cool now rather

95
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,480
than sign uric acid urea can also be

96
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,160
used to make cyanide as at high

97
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,080
temperatures it reacts with hydroxides

98
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,170
to produce ammonia and cyanate this can

99
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,790
then react with carbon to make cyanide

100
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,190
as usual now we have our cooled mixture

101
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,760
of sodium cyanide sodium cyanide

102
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,650
symud Rock sides sodium carbonate and

103
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,080
leftover carbon to separate them we have

104
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,880
to get them all out - and sold them in

105
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,400
methanol the mixture is very hard like

106
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,650
rocks so I add the methanol directly to

107
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,240
it to soften and gradually break it up

108
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,220
and scoop it out once again I must

109
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,630
emphasize you wear gloves and have

110
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,040
safety precautions because this is a

111
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,780
highly toxic solution of methanol and

112
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,940
cyanide so here is our mixture of

113
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,430
methanol sodium cyanide and various

114
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,010
byproducts and side products stir it up

115
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,570
to break up the chunks to a fine powder

116
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,519
and dissolve as much of the sodium

117
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,550
cyanide as possible I found I had to add

118
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,680
more methanol to a total volume of 5

119
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,180
milli

120
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,889
because the solution was becoming

121
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:29,139
somewhat difficult to start now once all

122
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:30,820
this hard material has been reduced to a

123
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,430
fine powder continue stirring and start

124
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,680
adding 100 grams of sodium bicarbonate

125
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,530
add in small portions slowly doesn't

126
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,139
clump up into chunks what we're doing is

127
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:42,940
reacting the sodium bicarbonate with

128
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,889
some hydroxide hadn't confirmed sodium

129
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:47,259
carbonate sodium carbonate has low

130
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:49,180
solubility in methanol well sodium

131
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,880
hydroxide has high solubility so by

132
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,620
converting the submerged rock excited to

133
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,240
sodium carbonate it can be precipitated

134
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,449
out and separate from the sodium cyanide

135
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:00,009
after all these Summa carburetors added

136
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:01,539
let the mixture stir for about half an

137
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:05,139
hour and now we filter the mixture and

138
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,419
here is our methanol solution of sodium

139
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:10,330
cyanide there is a small amount of very

140
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,430
fine carbon dust and sodium carbonate

141
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,259
and bicarbonate we can easily filter

142
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:16,660
that again before we go further we

143
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,400
should test to make sure we really do

144
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,830
have cyanide here's a fresh prepared

145
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,320
solution of ferrous sulfate it's very

146
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,449
little only about maybe half the gram in

147
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:28,090
10 milliliters of water now we add a few

148
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,590
drops of the solution of cyanide and

149
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,030
methanol to the ferrous sulphate

150
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,370
solution what we're trying to make the

151
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,169
substance called Prussian blue which has

152
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,510
a deep blue color but Prussian blue

153
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,720
requires both iron 3 and iron 2 ions

154
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,000
since the solution of ferrous sulfate

155
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,150
fresh it only has iron 2 to create some

156
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,270
iron 3 ions I just add in a few drops of

157
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,449
hydrogen peroxide let me give it a shake

158
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:54,250
there we go something is happening let

159
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,539
me add it in a few more drops of the

160
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:58,270
cyanide solution there we go it's a very

161
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,970
strong blue color this is the pigment

162
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,460
Russian blue and this proves that we

163
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,580
have cyanide ions so now I fill trail

164
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,139
one more time to get rid of the very

165
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:10,539
fine particles and then I remove the

166
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:12,000
methanol by boiling it off I'm

167
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,380
distilling here because I want to reuse

168
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,479
the methanol for future runs and because

169
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,849
I want to reduce the air exposure they

170
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:20,650
are actually reacts with cyanide to

171
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,110
convert the harm of cyanide and here's

172
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,080
our dried sodium cyanide it's a bit

173
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,509
impure with some sodium carbonate but it

174
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:30,130
should be good enough for amateur uses

175
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,620
and here it is transferred to some vials

176
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,520
my total yield was about 19 grams this

177
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,700
yield is about 36% based on the sign

178
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,160
Eric acid I can probably improve the

179
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,170
yield by heating for longer dissolving

180
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,000
the survivor oxide and cyanuric acid

181
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,550
together in water first and then drying

182
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,010
and maybe using potassium hydroxide

183
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,500
instead swim hydroxide because the

184
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,300
decomposition temperature of potassium

185
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,300
cyanide is lower than sodium cyanide and

186
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,460
well considering how cheap the reagents

187
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,530
are I don't mind low yield as I can just

188
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,270
try again on larger scale to get warm

189
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,760
I'm going to be using sodium cyanide to

190
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,290
dissolve gold and doogle playing

191
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,510
experiments and I'll be using its

192
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,490
precursor to make the drug pure Metheny

193
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,860
know the irony you've used an extremely

194
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,200
lethal poison to make a life-saving drug

195
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,490
is not lost on me

196
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,620
but chemistry is amazing like that oh

197
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,290
yes a word of note on waste disposal

198
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,900
before toss them out or washing them to

199
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,360
soak the beakers flasks filter papers

200
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,130
and whatever else touch cyanide in

201
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,070
liquid chlorine bleach for a few days

202
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,300
these same epiclloyd a the bleached

203
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,190
oxides a cyanide in relatively harmless

204
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:39,000
cyanide thanks for watching if you would

205
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,170
like to support the continued production

206
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,240
of science videos like this one please

207
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,460
support the channel on patreon links are

208
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,760
in the video description

209
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,660
you
